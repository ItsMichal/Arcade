# Alt Arcade

Welcome to my Arcade. Here are my projects made for Creative Tech's Alternative Arcade Interfaces class. Expect a bunch of experimental projects and similar quality code.

## Notion Writeups

# Project List
---
## SliderPong
Ping pong.
#### Threejs - Nodejs - Socketio - Device Orientation (Gyro)

### [Full Writeup (Notion)](https://halmic.notion.site/ALT-Pong-Slider-Pong-180b425cfa57415c96e84a3d82d278be)

A WIP pong game made from poor decisions. Gyro Control/Three.js/Cannon.js/Socket.io. Auto-matchmaking, uses solely phone gyro. Alt control for PC/non-gyro device is WASD, but not recommended.

## Barcode Game
Scan and print to win.
#### Unity - Nodejs - Expressjs - Arduino

A game that uses a printer, barcode scanners, and a foot pedal to pit two players against each other in trial by combat. Game is WIP, but integration of Arduino, Barcode Scanners, and a Print service are all done. Dynamically generates and prints barcodes which when scanned causes players to attack/heal.

Game built by me, teamed up with [Max who did the Arduino and physical enclosure work](!https://github.com/eppsicle/alt-arcade/blob/main/pedal.ino).
